/*
Add a wallet by adding one object to walletRecords.
See docs/wallet-submissions.md for the full submission template.

Required:
- put the icon under public/hodl/wallets/<wallet-id>/icon.<ext>
- list every supported OS in `platforms`
- choose user as "beginner" or "experienced"
- set wallet-level `features` and `check` to the values that apply to every
  platform; use `platformOverrides` only when one platform genuinely differs
- list every acquisition path in `actions`. An action without a `platforms`
  field applies to every platform the wallet supports; use the field to scope
  store listings (App Store, Google Play) or per-OS downloads.

Maintainers validate rating accuracy before merge.

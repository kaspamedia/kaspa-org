# kaspa.org

## Stack

- Next.js App Router
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- PixiJS + CreateJS for the DAG visualization
- Playwright for smoke testing

## Routes

- `/` landing page with the live DAG hero
- `/lore` protocol overview and positioning
- `/hodl` wallets, exchanges, and on-ramp links
- `/build` developer resources and API/SDK entry points

## Local Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

For LAN device testing, use:

```bash
npm run dev:lan
```

That starts `next dev` on the detected LAN IP and prints the device-reachable
URL. If auto-detection picks the wrong host, override it with
`NEXT_DEV_HOST=192.168.1.50 npm run dev:lan`.

The AI launcher calls a same-origin route at `/api/ask`. Set the ASK server key
before using chat locally or on web hosting, and set the public site origin used
by external AI links. A simple starting point is:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then fill in the real values:

```bash
KASPA_NEWS_ASK_API_KEY=your_kaspa_news_partner_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN=https://kaspa.org
```

`KASPA_NEWS_ASK_API_KEY` is a private server-side key for
`https://kaspa.news/api/ask`. Do not expose it through browser JavaScript,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables, or static frontend bundles.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN` should point at a public site URL whose
`/llms.txt` file external AI tools can actually fetch.

`NEXT_DEV_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` remains available if you need to allow extra custom
development origins beyond the defaults used by `npm run dev:lan`.

The `/api/ask` route follows the current Kaspa.news partner API contract. It
posts server-side to `https://kaspa.news/api/ask` with `op: "query"`,
`question`, `stream: false`, and `mode: "knowledge"`, then returns the
non-streaming `answer` JSON to the browser. The upstream answer can include raw
HTML anchor tags in its source list; `src/app/api/ask/answer.ts` normalizes
http/https anchors into Markdown links before the client renders the response.
The route uses the Node runtime plus `node:https` for the upstream request
because Node/Next `fetch` adds browser-style fetch metadata that Kaspa.news
currently rejects on the private partner-key endpoint.

## Quality Checks

Run the repo checks locally before shipping changes:

```bash
npm run verify
```

Tracked Git hooks now provide a lighter local safety net:

- `pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` on staged files
- `pre-push` runs `npm run verify`

If you want to mirror CI more closely before a larger push, run:

```bash
npm run verify:full
```

The smoke suite uses Playwright. Install Chromium once on a machine, then run:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

Helpful Playwright commands:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## CI

GitHub Actions lives at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run types:check`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:e2e`

The Playwright job uploads `playwright-report/` and `test-results/` as artifacts when the smoke suite fails.

## Project Notes

- Shared site metadata lives in the route layouts under `src/app/`.
- The home page DAG experience is implemented from `src/dag-viz/` and mounted through the app components.
- The AI launcher sends questions through `src/app/api/ask/route.ts`, so the browser never sees the private Kaspa.news ASK key.
- ASK source-link formatting is normalized server-side in `src/app/api/ask/answer.ts`; do not enable raw HTML rendering in the chat UI to handle upstream links.
- Keep the ASK route on the Node runtime; using server-side `fetch` for the private Kaspa.news endpoint can be rejected as browser-style traffic.

## Content Checklist

When editing content, verify:

- homepage hero copy still fits small mobile widths
- theme toggle and mobile nav still work
- home CTAs still land on the correct pages and anchors
- `/lore`, `/hodl`, and `/build` still render their primary H1 cleanly

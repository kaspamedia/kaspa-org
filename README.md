# kaspa.org

## Stack

- Next.js App Router
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- PixiJS + CreateJS for the DAG visualization
- Playwright for smoke testing

## Routes

- `/` landing page with the live DAG hero
- `/lore` protocol overview and positioning
- `/hodl` wallets, exchanges, and on-ramp links
- `/build` developer resources and API/SDK entry points

## Local Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

For LAN device testing, use:

```bash
npm run dev:lan
```

That starts `next dev` on the detected LAN IP and prints the device-reachable
URL. If auto-detection picks the wrong host, override it with
`NEXT_DEV_HOST=192.168.1.50 npm run dev:lan`.

The AI launcher is disabled by default. Leave
`NEXT_PUBLIC_KASPA_AI_ENABLED=false` while the ASK backend is unavailable. When a
replacement backend is ready, set it to `true`, set the ASK server key before
using chat locally or on web hosting, and set the public site origin used by
external AI links. A simple starting point is:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then fill in the real values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_KASPA_AI_ENABLED=false
KASPA_NEWS_ASK_API_KEY=your_kaspa_news_partner_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN=https://kaspa.org
```

When `NEXT_PUBLIC_KASPA_AI_ENABLED` is not set to `true`, the bottom launcher,
page-level AI buttons, suggested question pills, and ASK entry points are hidden.
The `/api/ask` route returns `503` without calling the upstream service.

`KASPA_NEWS_ASK_API_KEY` is a private server-side key for
`https://kaspa.news/api/ask`. Do not expose it through browser JavaScript,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables, or static frontend bundles.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN` should point at a public site URL whose
`/llms.txt` file external AI tools can actually fetch.

`NEXT_DEV_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` remains available if you need to allow extra custom
development origins beyond the defaults used by `npm run dev:lan`.

The `/api/ask` route follows the current Kaspa.news partner API contract. It
posts server-side to `https://kaspa.news/api/ask` with `op: "query"`,
`question`, `stream: false`, and `mode: "knowledge"`, then returns the
non-streaming `answer` JSON to the browser. The upstream answer can include raw
HTML anchor tags in its source list; `src/app/api/ask/answer.ts` normalizes
http/https anchors into Markdown links before the client renders the response.
The route uses the Node runtime plus `node:https` for the upstream request
because Node/Next `fetch` adds browser-style fetch metadata that Kaspa.news
currently rejects on the private partner-key endpoint.

## Quality Checks

Run the repo checks locally before shipping changes:

```bash
npm run verify
```

Tracked Git hooks now provide a lighter local safety net:

- `pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` on staged files
- `pre-push` runs `npm run verify`

If you want to mirror CI more closely before a larger push, run:

```bash
npm run verify:full
```

The smoke suite uses Playwright. Install Chromium once on a machine, then run:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

Helpful Playwright commands:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Every locale registered in `src/i18n/locale-registry.ts` is included in the
build. Run the full translated-locale browser gate with:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:i18n:locales
```

To review a new translation, add and register it on its own branch, deploy that
branch through Vercel Preview, and inspect every localized route on desktop and
mobile. Merging the branch publishes the locale; there is no separate locale
lifecycle or build mode.

Builds generate ignored localized Build-example siblings under
`public/vendor/kaspa-wasm`. After stopping a local server, remove those derived
files with:

```bash
npm run -s i18n:artifacts -- --clean
```

## Language Contributions

To suggest a translation correction, volunteer as a translator or reviewer, or
request a new site language, follow the
[translation contribution process](docs/translations.md). Requesters provide
plain-language information, the locale and language endonym when known, and
their fluency or reviewer availability. Maintainers own repository placement
and publish each approved locale atomically across the complete site.

## CI

GitHub Actions lives at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run wallets:check`
- `npm run test:wallets`
- `npm run i18n:check`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run types:check`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:e2e`
- `npm run test:e2e:i18n:locales`
- `npm run test:e2e:ai`

The Playwright jobs upload `playwright-report/` and `test-results/` as artifacts
when a browser suite fails.

## Project Notes

- Route topology, namespaces, and sitemap settings live in
  `src/i18n/manifest.ts`; registered locales live in
  `src/i18n/locale-registry.ts`; and localized metadata is created in
  `src/i18n/site.ts`. Guarded `[locale]` page adapters in
  `src/i18n/page-route.ts` expose metadata through `generateMetadata`.
- Build-example SDK versions, names, paths, source URLs, and localized artifact
  inventory live in `src/i18n/build-example-contract.ts`; Bash reads that
  contract through `scripts/i18n/print-build-example-contract.mts`.
- Shared font/provider/analytics document primitives live in
  `src/app/document-shell.tsx`; JSON-LD serialization lives in
  `src/i18n/document.ts`. Next layout and global-not-found files keep ownership
  of their explicit `html`, `head`, and `body` elements.
- Language-selector options and eligibility live in
  `src/app/components/language-selector-model.ts`; `src/i18n/navigation.ts`
  uses `next-intl` for known-route locale switches, while
  `src/i18n/pathname.ts` preserves unknown-path encoding safely.
- The home page DAG experience is implemented from `src/dag-viz/` and mounted through the app components.
- The AI launcher requires both `NEXT_PUBLIC_KASPA_AI_ENABLED` and the
  route-locale capability in `src/i18n/site-capabilities.ts`; keep the deployment
  flag false until a working ASK backend is available.
- When enabled, the AI launcher sends questions through `src/app/api/ask/route.ts`, so the browser never sees the private Kaspa.news ASK key.
- ASK source-link formatting is normalized server-side in `src/app/api/ask/answer.ts`; do not enable raw HTML rendering in the chat UI to handle upstream links.
- Keep the ASK route on the Node runtime; using server-side `fetch` for the private Kaspa.news endpoint can be rejected as browser-style traffic.

## Content Checklist

When editing content, verify:

- homepage hero copy still fits small mobile widths
- theme toggle and mobile nav still work
- home CTAs still land on the correct pages and anchors
- `/lore`, `/hodl`, and `/build` still render their primary H1 cleanly
